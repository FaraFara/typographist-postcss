      </a>, it significantly simplifies the process of improving typography on
      the web. The framework s objective is to provide developers with the most
      simple, powerful and flexible tool that will take over all the routine
      work in the form of complex calculations. The Typographist builds a basic
      grid to establish the correct vertical rhythm on the basis of rem, and
      also establishes macro-tipography, which allows paying special attention
      to micro-tipographic details. Also the toolkit is perfectly combined with
      css grid layout.
